## Description
    
This application was built to overcome the challenges of remembering all the tasks that you need to complete each day. This application will help you to remember all the important details or just make simple notes for things you encounter each day. Throughout this project I gained a better understanding of how to work with Node.JS and Express.JS to build a user-friendly application.
